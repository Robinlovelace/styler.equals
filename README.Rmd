The goal of {styler.equals} is to provide an implementation of the 'equals style' used by Yuhei Xie, Colin Gillespie and many in the `#rspatial` community.

So far it basically just the 'tidyverse style' but with equals assignment.
In the future it may evolve, e.g. to implement the [Geocomputation with R style guide](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompr/blob/main/misc/our-style.md).

It is a third-party
style guide for [{styler}](https://styler.r-lib.org).


## Installation

You can install the released version of {styler.equals} from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("robinlovelace/styler.equals")
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
```

## Example

This is a basic example of how to style code with it.

```{r example}
library(styler.equals)
cache_deactivate()
text = "x <- 4
y = 3
a;
"

text_styled_equals = style_text(text)
text_styled_equals
```

A more complicated example showing that it also fixes other issues from the `styler` package is:

```{r}
style_text("a=2", scope = "tokens")
style_text("a=2", scope = I(c("tokens", "indention")))
```

```{r}
style_text(
  "tibble::tibble(
     small  = 2 ,
     medium = 4,#comment without space
     large  = 6
   )"
)
```
